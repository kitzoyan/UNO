Everyone will start with 7 cards in their hands.
In every round, players can only play cards that are either the same colour, the same number, or the same action type with the card that was previously played on top of the discard pile. 
If you do not have any valid cards, you will need to draw a card. You may choose to play or keep the drawn card if it is valid. You may also choose to draw a card even if you have valid cards to play.
Some cards have effects which skip players, reverse the rotation order, change the current colour, and force other players to draw cards if played. The first person to rid all their cards wins the game.
Remember to call out "Uno" if you have only one card remaining, no matter the circumstance. If a player forgets to call Uno, another player may call Uno as well to punish them. Players who are punished must draw 2 cards.
