|  This class controls the game loop of each game. You can make a new default |
|  game or load a game with a file. Inside this class, it contains all the    |
|  methods to keep track of the game progress, like current color, current    |
|  card, order of players (PlayerManager), drawing card for a player          |
|  (PlayerManager) and tracking if the game has ended (access player decks    |
|  through PlayerManager). This class can also be extended into different     |
|  game mode, like tutorial mode.                                             |
